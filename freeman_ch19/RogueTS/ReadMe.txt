The following source code is provided as an example to go along with my chapter.

To use this code right away, simply install the following on your computer:

    - Node
    - Grunt Command Line Globally

Once you have those installed, simply navigate to the directory via the command line
and run the following command:

    > nmp install

This will download all of the dependant node modules needed to run TypeScript and
the project.

To get the compiler running, simply type the following:

    > grunt

After that, your browser should open with the TypeScript Rogue Engine.
